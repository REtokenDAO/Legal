# REtoken DAO | The Real Estate DAO

# Mission
REtoken DAO aims to:
1. Become recognized as “The Real Estate DAO”
2. Create a recurring multilingual educational virtual summit that will be delivered for free
3. Develop a 3-tiered Fractionalized Real Estate certificate program that provide CEUs (Continuing Education Unit); and

# Founding Principles

# REtoken DAO | Season 0 / 1

## What is a “Season”?
A season is an agreed upon window of time when members can align on projects that help us in achieving our broader mission.

## Season 0 | Genesis
During this initial season we are laying a solid foundation while being intently focused on delivering value to our members.

## Season 1 | Initial DEX Offering (IDO) Listing
When $RETOKEN becomes listed on a DEX (UniSwap, SushiSwap, HoneySwap, Acala, etc), this will initiate season 1.

# Governance Process

## Board of Stewards
The community has agreed to “roadmap” implementing a [Board of Stewards (BoS) (see write up on SporkDAO)](https://forum.sporkdao.org/t/sporkdao-board-of-stewards-role/53). We anticipate that this process will occur within Season 0 with the expectation that the BoS will initiate efforts and planning migration into Season 1.
